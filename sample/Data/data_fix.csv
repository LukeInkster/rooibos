(w/o umbrella),,,,,,,,Maurya,,,,,Architecture,"Sanchi is of historical significance as an early Buddhist, hill-top monastery of well-preserved stupas that prospered around the first century B.C. and subsequent centuries, near the political trade center of Vidisha.  The Great Stupa (Stupa 1) is the earliest and largest of fifty-one monuments -- monuments that were numbered and documented by John Marshall in the early 1900s.  Although scholars date the present dimensions of the stupa to a building phase in c. 150 BC, there is archaeological evidence that the inner brick core of the stupa was erected during Ashoka's reign (c. 272-231 B.C.).  The later addition of four monumental stone gateways (toranas) were intricately carved with reliefs depicting jatakas (narratives of the Buddha's earlier lives) and other scenes related to events of the historical Buddha.  Significantly, there is no anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha on the gateways.  The form of the stupa is integral with its function in Buddhist devotional rites: the solid, circular mound, which contains relics of the Buddha, is enclosed by an ambulatory path with unadorned stone railings (vedika) that is accessed through the four gateways by which the worshipper circumambulates a prescribed number of times, keeping the monument to his right.  An upper ambulatory passageway is also provided for the worshipper.  A smaller railing (harmika) at the apex of the dome encloses the pole (yasti), which represents the central axis of the stupa, and in turn the axis of the universe. Three umbrellas (chattras) function as honorific elements by which their symbolism includes protection of the elements below.",TRUE,Total from east,"Saskia, Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
